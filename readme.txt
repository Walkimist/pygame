This is a small rogue-like game project, greatly inspired by vampire survivors and its contemporaries.
Time to develop was a little over 18 hours total. I tried to make the most out of Pygame Zero; spend most of the time developing
the different systems and didn't focus much on balance, but I hope it's fun either way!

Python version used: 3.13.2
Libraries used: Pygame Zero, math, random

Installing and running instructions:
1- Open a cmd/powershell terminal

3- Have the installed folder's directory correct path selected in the terminal "cd <path_to_directory>"
4- Run the game using the command "pgzrun main.py", the game may take a few seconds upon first running
