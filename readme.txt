This is a small rogue-like game project, greatly inspired by vampire survivors and its contemporaries.
Time to develop was a little over 18 hours total. I tried to make the most out of Pygame Zero; spend most of the time developing
the different systems and didn't focus much on balance.
I hope it's fun either way!
